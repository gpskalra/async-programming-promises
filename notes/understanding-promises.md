1. race condition - when a system's behavior is dependent on the sequence or timing of some events. It is a bug when the one or more possible outcomes are undeseriable. Example - if request A's response is required by request B, the system wont work if A's result comes after B and we are assuming As response is present when Bs response arrives.
2. One solution is to make a callback pyramid - nest the second call inside the success callback of the first.
3. Drawbacks of callback pyramid - dirty error prone code (multiple nested onloads for example), adding error handling leads to more dirty code (xhr3.onerror inside xhr2.onload). Another drawback (my view) is bad performance. We are waiting for one operation to complete before making a call for the second.
4. promise - an object that represents eventual completion of an asynchronous operation. Has states and can give a value on completion and a reason on failure. will help get the benefits of nesting without the dirty code.
